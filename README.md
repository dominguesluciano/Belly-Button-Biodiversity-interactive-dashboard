# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Interactive dashboard with Plotly.js


### Synopsis

An interactive dashboard to explore [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Visualizations

The dashboard allows the selection of tests samples by ID and display its information in three different visualizations:

* Table
* Horizaontal bar chart
* Bubble charts

The table shows demographic information for each sample from individuals that undergo the test. The horizontal bar chart indicates which bacterias were found in each sample and its amount. The Bubble Chart adds a new layer of information enabling the comparison of all bacteria present on the seleced sample and the amount for each bacteria.


### Deployment

The dashboard can be visualized in as a Heroku App: https://bit.ly/2BsAXCs
